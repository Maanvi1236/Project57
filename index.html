        <p> I like reading📖📒 because it give me peace in my free time. I like reading📔📗 new stories both in hindi and english. It also make you understand the story and make your reading📔📗 good ,which also helps us in many ways,like it help us in school🏤, libraries🕍, giving speech and in many other ways. If you read science or social science chapters it will also help you in understanding it a little and you can discover new and different words and their's meaning and also you can learn how to make different sentences.
         
            <h4> Here are some quotes on reading📘📕</h4>
    <h5> A little reading is all the therapy that a person needs sometimes.</h5>
            <h6> Books📕 lovers never go to bed alone. They go with their books📕.</h6>
            <h7> There is only one thing that can replace a book📒 that is an another book📒.</h7>
            <br>

         <h8> THANK YOU FOR READING📙 MY HOBBY.</h8>
